# Playschool-Management-System
- This is my group project with the Intellect Playschool, JB (client) using HTML, CSS, PHP, MYSQL

We are assigned to create a website for a preschool by the owner of Intellect Playschool located at Johor Bahru. My team consists of 5 people, and I am in charge of the salary part and announcement & activity module. We managed to complete our website by the deadline given which is 3 months.

This module is for every user who is a parent, a teacher and an admin; since the admin inherits the teacher. The module must be accessed through the login module.

## Salary module
This module allows the admin to manage the salaries of teachers. The admin can create, manage, and view payslips for each month. Teachers can also view their payslips for a specific month. For the “Create Salary”, the admin can create a salary for each teacher for a specific month by entering the required details such as basic pay, allowance, deduction, overtime, etc. Then the “Edit Salary” and “Delete Salary”, the admin can manage payslips by editing or deleting them as required. For the “View Salary”, the admin can view all the payslips that have been generated, including the details of each payslip but teachers only can view their payslips based on the month. The system will display the payslip with all the details of the basic pay, allowance, deduction, overtime, etc.

## Announcement & Activity module
This module is for every user who is a parent, a teacher and an admin; since the admin inherits the teacher. Every user can access the Announcement module. This module is usually accessed through a menu or dashboard within the system. There are two selections in the announcement module, which are "Manage Announcement" and "View Announcement." Parents are only allowed to access "View Announcement" and teachers can access "Manage Announcement" which has sub-functions in that function. In the "Manage Announcement" function, teachers can also access the "View Announcement". In "Manage Announcement", there are three sub-functions: "Update Announcement", "Create Announcement" and "Delete Announcement". Each sub-function has its own functionality that only teachers have access to. The "Create Announcement" function, has a sub-function that allows teachers to upload media such as documents, pictures, videos, and others to the announcement.
